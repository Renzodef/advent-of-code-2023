# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles, implemented using the Go programming language.

## Structure

Each day's puzzles are organized in separate directories named `day1`, `day2`, etc. Inside each day's directory, there are subdirectories for each puzzle, typically `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`.

## Running Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the specific puzzle directory (e.g., `day1/puzzle1`) and use the Go command:

```bash
go run output.go
```

This will print the solution for that specific puzzle.

Happy Coding!
